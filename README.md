# camjam_pygame_car

got a [cam jam edukit 3](https://camjam.me/?page_id=1035) and shoddily stole some of their [code](https://github.com/CamJam-EduKit/EduKit3/blob/master/CamJam%20Edukit%203%20-%20RPi.GPIO/Code/7-pwm2.py) and turned it into a class and added [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/joystick.html) and used the [retropie](https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/wiki) setup script to add my bluetooth controller.
