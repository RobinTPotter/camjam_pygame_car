# camjam_pygame_car

Got a [cam jam edukit 3](https://camjam.me/?page_id=1035) for my birthday and shoddily stole some of their [code](https://github.com/CamJam-EduKit/EduKit3/blob/master/CamJam%20Edukit%203%20-%20RPi.GPIO/Code/7-pwm2.py) and turned it into a class and added [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/joystick.html) and used the [retropie](https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/wiki) setup script to add my bluetooth controller. I will not cheapen this entry and lower myself to advertising which make, suffice it to say it was inexpensive and I have already taken it apart to solder a bit which came off when dropped.

This was created for a raspberry pi zero w. Use stretch rather than stretch lite and save yourself a bit of hassle.

For added hassle, configure wlan0 as wireless access point and code on the bus with your Pi in your top pocket. Take care, however, prolonged use can singe a nipple.
